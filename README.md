A machine learning-based project to detect credit card fraudulence

# Running the system

I have used streamlit platform to test the model. The app.py file in the Models folder can be used to access the same.

You will have to run using the below code:

!streamlit run app.py

You will receive the below output in which, you need to click on the 'your url is: https://every-steaks-hunt.loca.lt', which will redirect you to the platform.

- Collecting usage statistics. To deactivate, set browser.gatherUsageStats to False.

You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
